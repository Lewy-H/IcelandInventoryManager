I find it useful to commit the .vscode directory so every user doesn't need to configure their own tasks.json and launch.json files.

[Bb]in/ cover both bin/ and Bin/
[Oo]bj/ cover both obj/ and Obj/

Or I misunderstood your interrogation ?

Does this work for VS 2019 projects?

I do not try it but I guess it does. You may need to check before commit if there are some undesired files but it may cover it pretty nicely.

Thanks for sharing, is important to include this file in the root folder of the local repository before doing your first "git add" if you already have some file in the repository you can check this question in stackoverflow - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31543997/make-git-ignore-dll-pdb-and-similar-generate-files
